Hello, this is a sandbox project where I implement and showcase "simple" solutions for basic stuff in Java using Spring Boot framework.

This project is mainly for demonstration purposes and to have a place where I can collect stuff for re-use...

Maybe it will grow over time, maybe not.

**In this project I used:**
* Java,
* Object-oriented, functional, generic and aspect-oriented (Spring AOP) programming,
* DI,
* Factory, Builder, Decorator, Singleton (lol) patterns,
* N-tier MVVM architecture (sounds fancy, even when you know what it is, right?),
* Gradle,
* Spring Boot (servlet, maybe will update to a Webflux later),
* Spring Security,
* Spring Boot HATEOAS,
* Spring data JPA,
* Jakarta persistence API,
* Flyway DB migration,
* Model mapper,
* Lombok,
* Swagger MVC UI,
* Asynchronous, Logstash encoded JSON logging with Logback (including logging with Spring AOP),
* JUnit 5,
* Reactive Spring WebTest Client (the netty one, for integration tests),
* Test Containers,
* Mockito,
* Allure reporter,
* Docker,
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
* etc.

**Possible plans for upcoming updates**:
* Break down APIs into browser API and public RESTful,
* Setup security configuration properly,
* Fix unit and integration tests, lol. And improve coverage,
* Go reactive with re-working the project to use Spring WebFlux,
* Native executables for GraalVM,
* Break down logic into microservices (where the current backend project will be an API gateway),
* Showcase for CQRS pattern microservices,
* Showcase for NoSQL DB microservice,
* Showcase for Kafka producer/consumer microservice,
* Showcase for Websockets in API gateway service,
* Showcase for GraphQL API (cursed) in API gateway service,
* Showcase for WebRTC in API gateway service,
* Showcase for gRPC microservices,
* Showcase for data caching using Redis,
* Make front-end (probably Angular, rxJS, shadcn, tailwind, etc.),
* Make infrastructure setup using Kubernetes, Helm (including all backend services, SQL, noSQL DBs, Redis, Kafka, frontend),
* Add telegraf agents and InfluxDB to infrastructure and configure metrics collection,
* Add Grafana to infrastructure and setup dashboards,
* Add ELK (or one of the forks) to infrastructure and setup log collection,
* Make load tests (probably using k6),
* Make API e2e tests (probably using Rest Assured),
* Make UI tests using Playwright,
* Maybe use some Kotlin and Go implementing mentioned microservices?
* Etc.

Maybe I will even actually do one or two things from the list someday...(probably not)
