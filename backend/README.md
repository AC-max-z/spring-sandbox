Simple Spring Boot MVC servlet app with Spring data JPA, HATEOAS, configured to work with Postgresql database.

You can configure your database connection in `src/main/resources/application.yml`, play with it using swagger ui url at http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/index.html.

Just make sure you got your user created first to authenticate.

Work in progress...
